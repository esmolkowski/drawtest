# drawtest
 A basic 3d software rendering engine. Draws basic wireframe shapes using the cpu in an interactive 3d environment. Designed to be independent of any drawing/rendering libraries. Currently uses SDL2, but only for timing and drawing 2d lines. Switching to a new library would be relatively painless and easy. All 3d transformations and projections are done library agnostic.

 Made over the course of a couple of days a few months ago. Many features are hastily implemented and a little bit messy. I plan to return to this project soon to clean up the code and further develop this engine into a small game or physics simulation.
